# Dino Game
This project is a clone of the Google Dino game, created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this simple yet engaging game, you control a dinosaur that must jump over cactus to keep running. The game features a scoring system that tracks your progress as you navigate through the obstacles and a Game Over feature too.
